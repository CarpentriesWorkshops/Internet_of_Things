## Software Setup

::: discussion

### Details

For this workshop we need to download and install the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE). There are now quite few different options for doing this which are all available on the [Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

In the first instance there is an option for programming your microcontroller board from a web browser using the web editor. If you have a stable Internet connection this would be a good option. Although this version of the IDE runs in a web browser you still need to install a browser plugin and a small software component called the Create Agent. You will also need to create an account on the Arduino website. One of the advantages of making use of this option is that your sketches (the programs you write to upload to the microcontroller) are saved in The Cloud which makes it easy to retrieve if you have to work on another computer.

For the Windows operating system you can download the IDE as a zip file, an exe file or you can get it from the Windows app store. There are also installation packages to be downloaded if you are using Linux or MacOS. Follow the instructions on the Arduino website for the option you decide to select. Your instructor should be able to guide you in your decision.
